# This is a script which will automate the process of logging in to nethack.
# It will either prompt for your username, password and binge at every run
# Or you can store that information in a file named ~/.nethackpasswd.
# The format of the nethackpasswd is as follows:
# 	user:pass:binge
# All fields are required.
# If you use a nethackpasswd file, it would be in your best interest run chmod 600 

set nethackpasswd "~/.nethackpasswd"
